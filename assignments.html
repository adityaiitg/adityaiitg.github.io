				<h3 href=""><b>Web Development</b></h3>
				<div class="blog-meta">Assignment 1</a></div>
								<div class="blog-date">January 20, 2020</div>

								<img src="Images/Web.png" alt="">

				<p>The first Assignment in DSL810: Prototyping in IoT, was to build a website. Basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were discussed in class, as well as relevant links were provided for practice. The main objective of the website was a basic introduction of the student and a section for assignments as well as a project. In this section, I'd describe the steps I followed while making my first website.</p>

				<br>

			
				<p><a href="assignment1.html"><b>Read More<b></a><p>

			<!-- 
				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">First Attempt</font></b></p>

				<br>

				<p>I first used a code for a website made by my schoolmate: Siladityaa Sharma. He's currently pursuing his Bachelor in Design from the ArtCenter College of Design. I made changes to his HTML and CSS files, and came up with a portfolio webisite of my own.</p>

				<br>

				<img src = "Images/Attempt1.png" border="5">

				<br>

				<p>Although the interface of the website looked minimal and aesthetic, there's wasn't much scope to add a lot of attributes. As I had to include sections for Assignments as well as project, I had to look for another template.

				<br><br>

				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Second Attempt</font></b></p>

				<br>

				<p>I chose a new template available on "ColorLib", to add more functionalities to the design I had in my mind. I changed most of the aspects of the template to make it more personalized so that I was able to build my first website.</p>

				<br>
				<img src = "Images/Attempt2.png" border="5">

				<br><br>

				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Softwares Used</font></b></p>
				<br>
				<p> Here is the list of softwares that I used to make the website:</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>• Sublime Text</b></p>
				<p>Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. It has a slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance. The code of HTML, CSS and JavaScript was edited on this software.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>• MAMP</b></p>
				<p>MAMP stands for ‘Mac Apache MySQL PHP’. It is used to test the files on our local browser before we upload it on the actual server. This is extremely helpful because uploading files again and again on the server is time consuming. MAMP gives instant editing results.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>• WinSCP</b></p>
				<p>WinSCP is a free and open-source client for Microsoft Windows. Its main function is secure file transfer between a local and a remote computer.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>• Adobe Illustrator</b></p>
				<p>DescriptionAdobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by Adobe Inc. This was used to design the graphic elements used in the website.</p>

				<br><br>

				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Key points learned</font></b></p>
				<br>
				<p> Here are some of the key points learned during the process:</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>• HTML</b></p>
				<p>The most important things learned in HTML were attaching images, making classes and adding lists.</p>


				<br>


				<img src = "Images/ht1.png" border="5">


				<br><br>
				<img src = "Images/ht2.png" border="5">

				<br><br>
				<p><b>• CSS</b></p>
				<p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</p>

				<br>


				<img src = "Images/CSS1.png" border="5">


				<br><br>
				<p><b>• JavaScript</b></p>
				<p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows us to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for us to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — we can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>

				<br>


				<img src = "Images/JS.png" border="5">
				<br><br>

				<p><b>• Bootstrap</b></p>
				<p>DescriptionBootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.</p>

				<br>
				<img src = "Images/bs.png" border="5">
				<br><br>
				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Image Compression</font></b></p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Compress JPEG</b></p>
				<p>Batch compression of images was done on <a href="https://compressjpeg.com/">compressjpeg.com<a></p>

				<br>
				<img src = "Images/Compress.png" border="5">
				<br><br>

				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Template</font></b></p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Colorlib</b></p>
				<p>The template for this website was taken from <a href="https://colorlib.com/">colorlib.com<a></p>

				<br>
				<img src = "Images/cl.png" border="5">
				<br><br>
				<p>Colorlib provides downloadable templates for a variety of pages. The downloaded files include the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files of that particular template. For making changes to the template, I had to make changes to the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. A basic understanding of these 3 languages is required to use the template. Keeping the basis ouline of the template provided to me, I played around the graphics and the text elements. Having decided my own Information Architecture for the site, I used the template to implement the same.</p>

				<br><br>

				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Conclusion</font></b></p>
				<br>
				<p>In conclusion, I'd like to say that the Assignment helped to understand how to implement HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a website. I also learned uploading files on a server. The major problem that I faced was working with JavaScript. While HTML and CSS are relatively easy to understand, I had difficulty to getting a good hold of JavaScript in the given time. Another problem that I faced while using the template was with the allignment of different text and graphic elements. It took me a while to get the right allignment, but I was able to do it in the end. It was a long and challenging task, but I enjoyed the process and learnt a lot!<a></p>

				<h3 href=""><b>Project Proposal</b></h3>
				<div class="blog-meta">Assignment 2</a></div>
								<div class="blog-date">February 3, 2020</div>

								<img src="Images/pro.jpg" alt="">

				<p>The first Assignment in DSL810: Prototyping in IoT, was to come up with a proposal for the course project. The project should use both uC prohramming, embedded programming, electronics (input+output devices) skills, as well as UI in laptop/mobile app. I decided that I'll be working on the project, "Hand Gesture Controlled Wifi Robot", along with my project partner, Animesh Singh.</p>
				<br>
				<p><a href="assignment2.html"><b>Read More<b></a><p>

			<!-- 
				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Hand Gesture Controlled WiFi Robot</font></b></p>

				<br>

				<p>The aim of the project is to build a Raspberry Pi Rover Robot, which can travel through rough terrain and can be controlled using hand gestures. Apart from the movement, the other settings of the robot can be controlled by a mobile app and the website. We will also fit a camera on the robot, and the display could be seen on the app.</p>
				<br>
				
 			    <p>• Wireless controlled robots are useful in applications like remote surveillance & military.</p>
  			    <p>• Hand gesture controlled robot can be used by physically challenged in wheelchairs.</p>
  				<p>• Hand gesture controlled industrial-grade robotic arms can be developed.</p>
  				<p>• Hand gesture controlled robots can also be used for earth and space exploration.</p>

				<br>
								<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Approach</font></b></p>

				<br>
				<p>We will use a control glove which acts as a gesture sensor to drive the Robot. The gesture sensor will have both an accelerometer and a flex sensor to control the status and direction it should be going. The flex sensor activates the Robot and the tilt of the accelerator determines the direction it should move.</p>
				<br>
				<p>We will use Raspberry Pi and Arduino to create our Gesture Controlled Robot. Arduino to make the control glove, which will detect the hand gestures and send the data to Robot via WiFi. We will use a Raspberry Pi to make the Robot, which will receive the data sent from the Arduino, process them and control the bot.</p>


				<br><br>

				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Components Required</font></b></p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Gesture Controller Glove<b></p>
					<br>
				 <p>• Gloves</p>
  			    <p>• Accelerometer</p>
  				<p>• Flex sensor</p>
  				<p>• Any Arduino Board with Wi-Fi connectivity</p>
				<p>• Breadboard</p>
  				<p>• Resistor</p>

  				<br>
				<p><b>The Robot<b></p>
					<br>
				 <p>• Robot Chassis</p>
  			    <p>• L293D motor driver</p>
  				<p>• Raspberry Pi or another Arduino (for controlling the robot)</p>
				<p>• Breadboard</p>
  				<p>• Resistor</p>
				<br><br>
				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Skills Used</font></b></p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Microcontroller + Embedded Programming<b></p>
				<br>
				<p>A major skill that would be used in the design of both the components i.e. the glove controller and the wireless robot. We plan on using a wifi-enabled Arduino board for the glove and using a Raspberry Pi for controlling the robot.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Electronics (Input+Output Devices)<b></p>
				<br>
				<p>Many sensors will be required as input devices including accelerometer, flex sensors, proximity sensors, etc.  Output devices will be motor drivers, small wheels for the robot, LEDs, displays, etc.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>CAD & Additive/Subtractive Fabrication<b></p>
				<br>
				<p>We want to produce & construct the robot chassis ourselves and for that, we would require CAD and 3D printing facilities.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>UI in Mobile App<b></p>
				<br>
				<p>We plan on building a remote controller for setting some functionalities on the robot wirelessly through a mobile app. An example could be setting the speed, LED settings, control sensitivity, etc.</p>
				<br><br>

				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Anticipated Challenges</font></b></p>

				<br>
				<p>• Both of us are attempting such a project for the first time, hence a challenge in this task would be to learn and effectively apply all the skills that are required to bring this project to completion, and more.</p>
  				<p>• We plan on producing & constructing the robot chassis ourselves using CAD and 3D printing, both of which are new skills and we may face some roadblocks in the process.</p>
				<p>• App development is another skill we have no prior experience at, hence that can be a potential challenge as well.</p>
  				<p>• We have a fair amount of wireless communication being used in different components of our project - the successful execution of which can pose a challenge for us.</p>
				<br><br>

				<p style='font-weight: 1000'><b><font size="5px", color="#08192d">Future Scope for the project</font></b></p>

				<br>
				<p>In the future, the project can be extended and a smartwatch app can be made for the user, so he can control the movement as well as the other settings through his hand entirely.</p>
